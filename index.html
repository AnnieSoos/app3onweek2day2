  Rules for Conway's Game of Life
  At the heart of this game are four rules that determine if a cell is live or dead. All depend on how many of that cell's neighbors are alive.

  Births. Each dead cell adjacent to exactly three live neighbors will become live in the next generation.

  Death by isolation. Each live cell with one or fewer live neighbors will die in the next generation.

  Death by overcrowding. Each live cell with four or more live neighbors will die in the next generation.

  Survival. Each live cell with either two or three live neighbors will remain alive for the next generation.

  Play continues until one of three things happens:

-all cells are dead
-no cells change from one generation to the next
-the pattern flips back and forth between two or more positions
